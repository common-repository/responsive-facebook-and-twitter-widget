= Follow these steps to find your Facebook ID =
Facebook Page plugin only works with pages, not with the personal profiles! First, you’ll need to retrieve your Facebook page ID. You can do this by navigating to your page, clicking on the About tab, and scrolling to the bottom of the page. There, you will see your page ID (It should be a number).
